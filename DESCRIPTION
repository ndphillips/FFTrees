Description: Create, visualise, and test fast and frugal decision trees (FFTrees). FFTrees are very simple decision trees for
    classifying cases (i.e.; breast cancer patients) into one of two classes (e.g.;
    no cancer vs. true cancer) based on a small number of cues (e.g.; test results). FFTrees can be preferable to more complex algorithms because they are easy to communicate, require very little information, and are
    robust against overfitting.
