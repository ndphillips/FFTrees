<!-- Pkg goal: -->

The R package **FFTrees** creates, visualizes and evaluates _fast-and-frugal decision trees_ (FFTs) for solving binary classification tasks, using the algorithms and methods described in Phillips, Neth, Woike & Gaissmaier (2017, doi\ [10.1017/S1930297500006239](`r url_JDM_doi`) | [html](`r url_JDM_html`) | [PDF](`r url_JDM_pdf`)). 


## What are fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs)?

_Fast-and-frugal trees_\ (FFTs) are simple and transparent decision algorithms for solving binary classification problems. 
The key feature making FFTs faster and more frugal than other decision trees is that every node allows making a decision. 
When predicting novel cases, the performance of FFTs competes with more complex algorithms and machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression\ (LR), support-vector machines\ (SVM), and random forests\ (RF). 
Apart from being faster and requiring less information, FFTs tend to be robust against overfitting, and are easy to interpret, use, and communicate.

<!-- Full quote: -->
<!-- These fast-and-frugal trees (Hafenbrädl et al.,2016; Phillips, Neth, Woike, & Gaissmaier, 2017) are especially relevant to the algorithm aversion discussion not only because they allow the human decision maker to dictate the external measures upon which an augmented decision will be judged, but also because they are transparent. This in turn suggests that human users could interpret, justify, control, and interact with a fast-and-frugal decision aid, which touches on virtually all the drivers of algorithm aversion covered in this review.  -->

```{r install-gitub, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ndphillips/FFTrees", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Getting started

As an example, let's create a FFT predicting patients' heart disease status (_Healthy_ vs. _Disease_) based on the `heartdisease` dataset included in **FFTrees**: 

```{r load-pkg, message = FALSE}
library(FFTrees)  # load package
```


### Using data 

The `heartdisease` data provides medical information for 303\ patients that were examined for heart disease. 
The full data contains a binary criterion variable describing the true state of each patient and were split into two subsets: 
A `heart.train` set for fitting decision trees, and `heart.test` set for a testing these trees. 
Here are the first rows and columns of both subsets of the `heartdisease` data: 

- `heart.train` (the training / fitting data) describes `r nrow(heart.train)` patients: 

```{r data-train, echo = FALSE}
n_train <- nrow(heart.train)
c_train <- paste0("**Table 1**: Beginning of the `heart.train` subset (using the data of ", n_train, " patients for fitting/training FFTs).")

knitr::kable(head(heart.train), caption = c_train)
```

- `heart.test` (the testing / prediction data) describes `r nrow(heart.test)` different patients on the same variables:

```{r data-test, echo = FALSE}
n_test <- nrow(heart.test)
c_test <- paste0("**Table 2**: Beginning of the `heart.test` subset (used to predict `diagnosis` for ", n_test, " new patients).")

knitr::kable(head(heart.test), caption = c_test)
```

Our challenge is to predict each patient's `diagnosis` ---\ a column of logical values indicating the true state of each patient (i.e., `TRUE` or\ `FALSE`, based on the patient suffering or not suffering from heart disease)\ --- from the values of potential predictors. 


### Questions answered by FFTs

To solve binary classification problems by FFTs, we must answer two key questions:

- Which of the variables should we use to predict the criterion? 
- How should we use and combine predictor variables into FFTs?

Once we have created some FFTs, additional questions include:

- How accurate are the predictions of a specific FFT?
- How does its performance compare with alternative machine-learning algorithms?
- How costly are the predictions of each algorithm?

The **FFTrees** package answers these questions by creating FFTs and allowing to evaluate, visualize, and compare them to alternative algorithms.


### Creating fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs) 

We use the main `FFTrees()` function to create FFTs for the `heart.train` data and evaluate their predictive performance on the `heart.test` data: 

```{r set-seed, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(246)  # for reproducible randomness
```

- The main `FFTrees()` function allows creating an `FFTrees` object for the `heartdisease` data: 

```{r example-heart-create, collapse = FALSE, results = "hide"}
# Create an FFTrees object from the heartdisease data: 
heart_fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                     data = heart.train,
                     data.test = heart.test, 
                     decision.labels = c("Healthy", "Disease"))
```

Evaluating `FFTrees()` analyzes the training data, creates several FFTs, and applies them to the test data. 
The results are stored in an object `heart_fft`, which can be printed, plotted and summarized (with options for selecting specific data or trees). 

<!-- - Printing an `FFTrees` object shows basic information and summary statistics (on the best training tree, FFT\ #1): -->

```{r example-heart-print, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Print:
heart_fft
```

- Let's plot our `FFTrees` object to visualize a tree and its predictive performance (on the `test` data): 

```{r example-heart-plot, eval = FALSE}
# Plot the best tree applied to the test data: 
plot(heart_fft,
     data = "test",
     main = "Heart Disease")
```

**Figure\ 1**: A fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) predicting heart disease for `test` data and its performance characteristics.  

- A summary of the trees in our `FFTrees` object and their key performance statistics can be obtained by `summary(heart_fft)`.

- Additionally, we can compare the predictive performance of different machine learning algorithms on a range of metrics: 

```{r example-heart-comp}
# Compare predictive performance across algorithms: 
heart_fft$competition$test
```


<!-- FFTs by verbal description: -->

### Building FFTs from verbal descriptions 

FFTs are so simple that we even can create them 'from words' and then apply them to data! 

For example, let's create a tree with the following three nodes and evaluate its performance on the `heart.test` data:

1. If `sex = 1`, predict _Disease_.
2. If `age < 45`, predict _Healthy_.
3. If `thal = {fd, normal}`, predict _Healthy_,   
otherwise, predict _Disease_. 

These conditions can directly be supplied to the `my.tree` argument of `FFTrees()`: 

```{r example-heart-verbal, eval = FALSE}
# Create custom FFT 'in words' and apply it to test data:

# 1. Create my own FFT (from verbal description):
my_fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~., 
                  data = heart.train,
                  data.test = heart.test, 
                  decision.labels = c("Healthy", "Disease"),
                  my.tree = "If sex = 1, predict Disease.
                             If age < 45, predict Healthy.
                             If thal = {fd, normal}, predict Healthy,  
                             Otherwise, predict Disease.")

# 2. Plot and evaluate my custom FFT (for test data):
plot(my_fft,
     data = "test",
     main = "My custom FFT")
```

![An FFT created from a verbal description.](man/figures/README-example-heart-verbal-1.png)

**Figure\ 2**: An FFT predicting heart disease created from a verbal description.  

As we can see, this particular tree is somewhat biased: 
It has nearly perfect _sensitivity_ (i.e., is good at identifying cases of _Disease_) but suffers from low _specificity_ (i.e., performs poorly in identifying _Healthy_ cases). 
Expressed in terms of its errors, `my_fft` incurs few misses at the expense of many false alarms. 
Although the _accuracy_ of our custom tree still exceeds the data's baseline by a fair amount, the FFTs in `heart_fft` (from above) strike a better balance. 

<!-- A range of options, rather than 1 optimum: -->

Overall, what counts as the "best" tree for a particular problem depends on many factors (e.g., the goal of fitting vs. predicting data and the trade-offs between maximizing accuracy vs. incorporating the costs of cues or errors). 
To explore this range of options, the **FFTrees** package enables us to design and evaluate a range of FFTs.
