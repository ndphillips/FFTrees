## Fast-and-Frugal Trees (FFTs)

```{r fig-1, fig.width = 7.2, fig.height = 6.5, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, fig.cap="A fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) to predict heart disease status."}
# Create a fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) predicting heart disease
heart.fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                     data = heart.train,
                     data.test = heart.test,
                     main = "Heart Disease",
                     decision.labels = c("Healthy", "Diseased"))

# Visualize the best training tree applied to the test data
plot(heart.fft, data = "test")
```

A _fast-and-frugal tree_ (FFT) [@martignon2003naive] is a set of hierarchical rules for making decisions based on very little pieces of information (usually\ 4 or fewer cues). 
Specifically, it is a decision tree where each node has exactly 2\ branches, where one (or in the cast of the final node, both) branches is an exit branch. 

FFTs are simple, transparent decision strategies that use minimal information to make decisions [see @gigerenzer1999fast;@gigerenzer1999good]. 
They are frequently preferable to more complex decision strategies (such as logistic regression) because they rarely over-fit data [@gigerenzer2009homo] and are easy to interpret and implement in real-world decision tasks [@marewski2012heuristic]. 
FFTs have been used in real world tasks from detecting depression [@jenny2013simple], to making fast decisions in emergency rooms [@green1997alters].

The purpose of the **FFTrees** package is to make it easy to produce, display, and evaluate FFTs [@phillips2017FFTrees]. 
The package's main function is `FFTrees()` which takes formula\ `formula` and dataset\ `data` arguments and returns several FFTs that attempt to classify training cases into criterion classes. 

## How to use the FFTrees package

To get started with **FFTrees**, we recommend studying the [Heart Disease Tutorial](FFTrees_heart.html). 
This tutorial will take you through all of the basics steps of creating, visualising, and evaluating fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs).

## Article and citation information

We had a lot of fun creating FFTrees and hope you like it too! 
We have an article introducing the `FFTrees` package in the journal _Judgment and Decision Making_ [FFTrees article PDF](https://journal.sjdm.org/17/17217/jdm17217.pdf). 
We encourage you to read the article to learn more about the history of FFTs and how the FFTrees package creates them.

If you use **FFTrees** in your work, please cite us and spread the word so we can continue developing the package.
